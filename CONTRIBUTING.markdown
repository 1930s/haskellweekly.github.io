If you want to bring our attention to something, please open an issue! This can
be used for anything from typos to new content. For example, this has been used
for events (#119), calls for participation (#138), jobs (#136), and bugs (#62).

If you want to make a change yourself, please open a pull request! We encourage
you to make changes when you can, and we'll work with you to get your changes
