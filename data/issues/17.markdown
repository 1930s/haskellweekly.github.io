- [Making Movie Monad](https://lettier.github.io/posts/2016-08-15-making-movie-monad.html)

  > Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can use Electron to develop a desktop application. The nice part about Movie Monad, however, is that we will create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Haskell.

- [Lens and Linear: 2048's logic in 22 lines](http://www.nmattia.com/posts/2016-08-19-lens-linear-2048.html)

  > It is actually a problem that can be solved elegantly in Haskell using a few Isos and Traversals. Weâ€™ll use the linear library for representing the data and the lens library for accessing it.

- [TechEmpower Benchmarks](https://turingjump.com/blog/tech-empower/)

  > Rather than wait for the official results, I ran the benchmarks with a handful of frameworks on a dedicated server. The results are, I think, enough to put these concerns to rest.
