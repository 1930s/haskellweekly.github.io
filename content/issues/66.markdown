Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on correctness, productivity, and expressiveness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Faster command line tools with Haskell](https://codygman.github.io/posts/2017-07-30-faster-command-line-tools-with-haskell.html)

    > What I wish to be true: I write high level Haskell code as declaratively and naively as possible and sufficiently smart compiler optimizations make it as fast as hand tuned Go code. Let's see if it works out that way!

-   [Using GHC `CallStack`s](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/07/29/using_ghc_callstacks.html)

    > Haskell doesn't really have a call stack. The evaluation strategy is more like a graph reduction. If you don't understand that, that's okay --- I don't either! All I know about it is that it makes questions like "What's the stack trace for this error?" surprisingly difficult to answer.

-   [GHC warnings you should use in addition to `-Wall`](https://functor.tokyo/blog/2017-07-28-ghc-warnings-you-should-enable)

    > There are some useful warnings that are not turned on by `-Wall`. This post will describe which additional warnings you should enable. It will also show examples of bad code that will trigger the warnings. Keep in mind that this bad code will *not* get caught by `-Wall`.

-   [To `Void` or to `void`](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/07/to-void-or-to-void)

    > Unfortunately, intuition and reasoning are not appearing in our types, and therefore we need to rely on our own inner reasoning checker instead of letting GHC enforce things for us. As things scale up, eventually it gets difficult to know what's happening in the code.

-   [Reflections on GHC's release schedule](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/blog/2017-release-schedule)

    > With 8.2.1 at long last behind us, now is a good time to reflect on why these cycles are so long, what release schedule we would like to have, and what we can change to realize such a schedule.

-   [Coping with (code) failures](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2017/7/31/coping-with-code-failures)

    > Haskell's error facilities are a lot better than most languages. This week we'll look at some common error handling patterns. We'll see a couple clear instances where Haskell has simpler and cleaner code.

-   [Elm in production: 25,000 lines later](https://charukiewi.cz/posts/elm/)

    > We have managed to take a set of functionality that would have been exceptionally difficult to build using our old methods, and using the strengths of the Elm language and architecture, successfully developed the largest feature in our entire software product to date.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [justified-containers](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/justified-containers-0.1.2.0),
a library that provide guarantees about the presence of keys within containers.
