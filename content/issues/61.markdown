Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Haxl: making concurrency unreasonably easy](http://events.techcast.com/bigtechday10/Garmisch-1345/)

    > Haxl is a big hammer for doing I/O concurrently, testing I/O, and modularity (caching & memoization).

-   [Introduction to Brick](https://samtay.github.io/articles/brick.html)

    > I'm going to give a short introduction to Brick, a Haskell library for building terminal user interfaces. So far I've used brick to implement Conway's Game of Life and a Tetris clone. I'll explain the basics, walk through an example snake application, and then explain some more complicated scenarios.

-   [Simplexhc: an STG to LLVM compiler](https://pixel-druid.com/blog/announcing-simplexhc/)

    > STG's lowering to C-- and the decisions taken when implementing it were based in the '90s. That's not to say that the GHC team hasn't done an awesome job keeping it up to date; they have! But, I wonder what a complete rewrite of this lowering would look like. Hence, I'm trying to experiment in this space and see what happens.

-   [Front Row is hiring a senior backend Haskell engineer](https://frontrow.workable.com/j/463B843754) (ad)

    > Come change how 6.5+ million K-12 US students learn Math, Language Arts, Social Studies and more. Use data, advanced type systems, great product design and deep pedagogy to change lives.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [data-has](https://www.stackage.org/lts-8.20/package/data-has-0.2.1.0),
a library that provides a simple extensible product system.
