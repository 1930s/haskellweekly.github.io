## Featured

-   [Beautiful aggregations with Haskell](http://tech.frontrowed.com/2017/09/22/aggregations/)

    > Aggregating data is a common, tedious task. In imperative languages we often end up with a rat's nest of mutable variables, nested loops and other awful constructs. In functional languages a naive implementation also results in spaghetti and usually less than ideal performance.

-   [Immutability and unboxing in array programming](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2017-09-27-array-package.html)

    > Well written code based on unboxed arrays and using the discussed pattern to create arrays by initializing a mutable version, which is subsequently frozen, can achieve performance comparable to low-level C code.

## Jobs

-   [Code Haskell. Build great things.](https://www.wrinkl.com/jobs/) (ad)

    > We're Wrinkl, a well-funded startup working closely with Obsidian Systems to build a powerful new communications platform. We use Haskell on both the backend and the frontend (using GHCJS and Reflex). And we're looking to hire Haskell developers, preferably in the Philly area or willing to relocate to Philly. Women and minorities strongly encouraged to apply.
