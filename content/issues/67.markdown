Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on correctness, productivity, and expressiveness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Wish: A trivial web browser written in Haskell](https://github.com/chrisdone/wish/blob/f6cb6ffa38e88a8fa082b2cff33c2da56c249608/README.md)

    > This is a demonstration program that is able to load a web page up and render it like in the early '90s. It supports laying out text, different font sizes for headings, inline and block elements, hyperlinks, bold and italics. It supports mouse wheel scrolling, too.

-   [Array programming in Haskell](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2017-08-09-array-programming-in-haskell.html)

    > On the confusing side, there are several different array libraries with overlapping feature sets, but distinct focus, strengths, and level of support, and often they have got widely different performance characteristics. This can make it hard to know where to start.

-   [Programming as if the correct data structure (and performance) mattered](http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/data-structures-matter/)

    > What if focusing on the correct data structure, while still understanding your algorithm, could improve maintainability and collaterally speed up execution by a factor of over 15x compared to over-engineered C# code?

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [monad-control](https://www.stackage.org/haddock/nightly-2017-08-10/monad-control-1.0.2.2/Control-Monad-Trans-Control.html),
a library that provides lift control operations (like exception catching) through monad transformers.
