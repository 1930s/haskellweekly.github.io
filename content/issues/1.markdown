-   [GHC 8.0.1 RC4 released ](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2016-April/011955.html)

    > If no major issues pop up we expect that this will be the last release candidate before the final release, which we hope to push out in the coming weeks.

-   [Stack 1.1 released](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

    > GPG signing of packages while uploading to Hackage is now the default.

-   [Cabal 1.24 released](http://coldwa.st/e/blog/2016-05-04-Cabal-1-24.html)

    > Nix-style local builds in cabal-install (so far only a technical preview).

    > A pure function always returns the same result and does not modify the environment. An impure function can return different results when it is executed repeatedly.

-   [ML modules vs. Haskell type classes](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36927169/ml-modules-vs-haskell-type-classes)

    > There is no system built into Haskell's type class system which allows you to choose between multiple instances. Instead you have to jump through hoops by wrapping and unwrapping them in skeleton types.
