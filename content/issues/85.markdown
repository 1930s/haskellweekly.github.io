## Featured

-   [A tour of Go in Haskell](https://a-tour-of-go-in-haskell.syocy.net/en_US/index.html)

    > Welcome to a tour of Go in Haskell. This site will show how to write the concurrency section of "A Tour of Go" in Haskell. "A Tour of Go" is a famous tutorial of Go. Haskell has concurrency features similar to Go: lightweight thread, channel, etc..

-   [All about strictness analysis: Part 1](http://fixpt.de/blog/2017-12-04-strictness-analysis-part-1.html)

    > Non-strict languages like Haskell often require the programmer to reason about strictness to achieve good performance. In this post, I want to offer a surgical approach to plugging space leaks that works hand in hand with optimizations carried out by the compiler.

## Jobs

-   [TVision Insights seeking Software Engineer in Boston](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/148122/backend-software-engineer-haskell-scala-clojure-tvision-insights)

    > As a key member of the development team, you will be responsible for designing and implementing solutions that analyze and process large data streams and populate our columnar analytics databases in AWS.
