Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [A tour of Go in Haskell](https://a-tour-of-go-in-haskell.syocy.net/en_US/index.html)

    > Welcome to a tour of Go in Haskell. This site will show how to write the concurrency section of "A Tour of Go" in Haskell. "A Tour of Go" is a famous tutorial of Go. Haskell has concurrency features similar to Go: lightweight thread, channel, etc..

-   [All about strictness analysis: Part 1](http://fixpt.de/blog/2017-12-04-strictness-analysis-part-1.html)

    > Non-strict languages like Haskell often require the programmer to reason about strictness to achieve good performance. In this post, I want to offer a surgical approach to plugging space leaks that works hand in hand with optimizations carried out by the compiler.

-   [Reading simple Haskell](https://soupi.github.io/rfc/reading_simple_haskell/)

    This slideshow presents basic Haskell syntax and explains how to read and understand it.

-   [Announcing generic-lens 0.5.0.0](http://kcsongor.github.io/generic-lens/)

    > The generic-lens library provides utilities for deriving various optics for your datatypes, using `GHC.Generics`. In this post I'll go over some of the features and provide examples of using them.

-   [JSaddle: ArrayBuffers and notifications](https://qfpl.io/posts/working-with-jsaddle/)

    > This post will demonstrate a couple of techniques for using the GHCJS helper libraries: jsaddle and jsaddle-dom to: Create an ArrayBuffer for use with WebGL, and leverage the Notification API available in some browsers.

-   [Benchmarking `strchr` vs `memchr`](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2017/12/benchmarking-strchr-vs-memchr.html)

    > There are two related C functions for finding the next character in a string: `strchr` which assumes the string has a NUL character at the end, and `memchr` which takes the string length as an argument. For strings where you have the size and a NUL terminator, which is fastest?

-   [Haskell for greater Elm](http://jstoelm.com/episodes/16-haskell-for-greater-elm.html)

    > We turn our attention back to Haskell to help us get the best possible foundation for really diggin' into functional programing. For me, only after doing piles of short examples does it sink in for me. It's the repetition and console output that is key.

-   [Haskellaus: Haskell meets Nikolaus](http://techblog.holidaycheck.com/post/2017/12/09/haskellaus-haskell-meets-nikolaus)

    > The lazily evaluated FP Saint Nicholas doesn't show up until you force him so he is a bit late, but this Friday is Haskellaus --- treats for the functionally inclined. Saint Nicholas has a bag full of challenges that we will try to solve.

## Jobs

-   [TVision Insights seeking Software Engineer in Boston](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/148122/backend-software-engineer-haskell-scala-clojure-tvision-insights)

    > As a key member of the development team, you will be responsible for designing and implementing solutions that analyze and process large data streams and populate our columnar analytics databases in AWS.
