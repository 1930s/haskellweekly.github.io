Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Understanding `ResourceT`](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/understanding-resourcet)

    > Instead of just teaching you how to use the library, this post will demonstrate why you need it and how it works internally, to help you avoid some of the potential pitfalls of the library.

-   [Announcing Weeder: dead export detection](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2017/06/announcing-weeder-dead-export-detection.html)

    > Most projects accumulate code over time. To combat that, I've written Weeder which detects unused Haskell exports, allowing dead code to be removed (pulling up the weeds).

-   [Dhall is now a template engine](http://www.haskellforall.com/2017/06/dhall-is-now-template-engine.html)

    > Now you can use Dhall as a template engine with the newly released `dhall-text` library which provides a `dhall-to-text` executable for templating text.

-   [Front Row is hiring a senior backend Haskell engineer](https://frontrow.workable.com/j/463B843754) (ad)

    > Come change how 6.5+ million K-12 US students learn Math, Language Arts, Social Studies and more. Use data, advanced type systems, great product design and deep pedagogy to change lives.

-   [Testing PostgreSQL for fun](https://hackernoon.com/testing-postgresql-for-fun-af891047e5fc)

    > In this post I'll show how to make database programming fun by using packages that make testing easy. I'll walk through a example of building a durable queue backed with PostgreSQL.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [async](https://www.stackage.org/lts-8.19/package/async-2.1.1.1),
a library that allows you to run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results.
