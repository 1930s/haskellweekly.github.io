Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [The Little Typer Interview](https://corecursive.com/023-little-typer-and-pie-language/)

    > You can write more correct software and even rigorous mathematical proofs. Let's learn about dependent types with Dan and David.

-   [Monadic Party](https://monadic.party)

    > It is the second edition of a Haskell summer school in PoznaÅ„, Poland. This time we have three tracks and as usual great speakers. The CFP is open and we have a scholarship program for people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

## Jobs

-   [Haskell Engineer at Mercury in San Francisco](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/a33krh/mercury_is_hiring_a_haskell_engineer_sf_fulltime/)

    > Mercury is a bank for tech startups. We're building a product that will power the future of American industry. This turns out to be pretty ambitious for a team of eight, so we're bringing one more product-minded engineer on board to help us achieve it.

-   [Internship at Kiel University](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/a1toop/haskellrelated_summer_internship_in_germany/)

    > We'd be very happy to host a motivated student, who is keen to improve our compiler for the functional logic programming language Curry in terms of performance.
