Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Understanding HLint rules](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2017/11/understanding-hlint-rules.html)

    > I've just released HLint 2.0.10, which includes a rule to recognize uses of `foldr` that should really be `map`. As an example: `foldr (\curr acc -> (+1) curr : acc) []` Can be rewritten as: `map (\curr -> (+1) curr)`

-   [Computing with impossible types](https://gelisam.blogspot.ca/2017/11/computing-with-impossible-types.html)

    > Edward Kmett recently posted a puzzling gist seemingly showing that at the type level, the `()` kind has more than one inhabitant. The goal of this post is to explain what's going on.

-   [Authorization in Servant: Walkthrough](https://ibnuda.gitlab.io/636452721192300168_authorizationinservant.html)

    > This article is about `servant-server` 0.11's `experimental-auth` which is still in experimental stage. Deployment in production is not encouraged. And yes, I know about `servant-auth` but I haven't read it thoroughly, yet.

-   [Eventful email signup](https://medium.com/@concertdaw/eventful-email-signup-f0814fc7d7fa)

    > We wanted to try out some of these new (to us) ideas to see how they would gel together and whether we would want to use any of them in production. What follows is my account of using David Reaver's event-sourcing/CQRS library, Eventful, to build our email sign-up backend.

-   [Organizing our effects effectively](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2017/11/6/organizing-our-effects-effectively)

    > We'll observe some of the weaknesses of this system, and how we can improve on them. This week will focus on an approach with type classes and monad transformers. In a couple weeks, we'll consider free monads, and how we can use them.

-   [Semantic integrity checks are the next generation of semantic versioning](http://www.haskellforall.com/2017/11/semantic-integrity-checks-are-next.html)

    > The Dhall configuration language just added support for "semantic integrity checks". This post explains what "semantic integrity check" means, motivates the new feature, and compares to semantic versioning.

## Jobs

-   [Functional programmers at Myrtle Software](https://www.myrtlesoftware.com/vacancies/)

    > Myrtle is looking for skilled developers to join our growing development team and assist with the development of our core compiler technology. Ideally candidates would have an interest in either efficient hardware design and/or machine learning models and frameworks.

## In brief

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [Smudge](https://github.com/Bose/Smudge/blob/c59fb0e2ce80d411456a68bb33d518e426a3ecde/README.md#readme),
a language for describing state machines as well as a compiler that interprets and validates those descriptions to generate code and documentation for them.
