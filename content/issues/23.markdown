-   [Using types to unit-test in Haskell](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/10/03/using-types-to-unit-test-in-haskell/)

    > By taking advantage of Haskell's expressive type system, it's possible to not only achieve parity with object-oriented testing techniques, but also to provide stronger static guarantees as well. Furthermore, it's all possible without resorting to extra-linguistic hacks that static object-oriented languages sometimes use for mocking.

    > wrecker is an HTTP benchmarking library and executable for profiling several API actions. wrecker is designed from the ground-up for scripting complex API sequences sublimely. Benchmarks can utilize a wreq-like interface, perhaps the easiest-to-use Haskell library for HTTP interaction, and quickly create wonderful, typed API clients.
