-   [Using types to unit-test in Haskell](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/10/03/using-types-to-unit-test-in-haskell/)

    > By taking advantage of Haskell's expressive type system, it's possible to not only achieve parity with object-oriented testing techniques, but also to provide stronger static guarantees as well. Furthermore, it's all possible without resorting to extra-linguistic hacks that static object-oriented languages sometimes use for mocking.

    > Qtah is a set of Qt bindings for Haskell, providing a traditional imperative interface to a mature GUI toolkit.
