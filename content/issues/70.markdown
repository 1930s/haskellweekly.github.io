Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on correctness, productivity, and expressiveness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Cross-referenced codebase for Stackage LTS 9.2 available](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2017-August/127823.html)

    > To find out who else uses your favorite functions and how. For example, click `async` to get all the call sites of that method.

-   [Compact normal forms + linear types = efficient network communication](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2017-08-24-linear-types-packed-data.html)

    > In this post, I want to use the same idea of tracking states in types, but applied to a more unusual example from our paper: sending rich structured data types across the network and back with as little copying as possible.

-   [Roll your own Bitcoin exchange in Haskell](http://www.michaelburge.us/2017/08/31/roll-your-own-bitcoin-exchange.html)

    > This article will show you how to: Design an order book that can handle limit orders and market orders; Install automated sanity checks that run on every write to the order book, preventing hacks and implementation bugs.

-   [An example of using laziness](https://noughtmare.gitlab.io/posts/2017-08-30-an-example-of-using-laziness.html)

    > The problem is about finding out in how many ways you can make change for a certain amount of money using an infinite supply of coins of different values.

-   [Beginner mistakes and oddities I encountered](https://jaredweakly.com/blog/beginner-mistakes-and-oddities-i-encountered/)

    > Time sure does fly don't it? I'm going to go over a lot of the beginner mistakes and little pitfalls and paper cuts I've encountered so far while working on the GHC test suite.

-   [Introducing Haskey (Summer of Haskell 2017)](https://deliquus.com/posts/2017-08-24-introducing-haskey.html)

    > This blog post introduces the Haskey project, an ACID compliant embedded key-value store entirely written in Haskell, based on an MVCC B+-tree implementation.

-   [Migrating a REST API from JavaScript to Haskell](https://blog.ismail-s.com/2017/08/30/migrating-a-rest-api-from-javascript-to-haskell/)

    > I noticed that running the server was costing me more than I'd like. This was because the REST API consumed too much memory, which cost me a bit too much money. So, to save money, I decided to rewrite the API in Haskell.

-   [Exiting a Haskell process](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/08/exiting-haskell-process)

    > To understand what's happening, let's look at a simplified version of the implementation of the `exitWith` function. I would have anticipated that this would, you know, actually exit the process.
