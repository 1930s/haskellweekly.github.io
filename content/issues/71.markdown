    > Revisiting the Movie Monad project, we remade the application using the software libraries GTK+ and GStreamer. By using GTK+ and GStreamer, the application remains as portable as the Electron version. Movie Monad can now handle large video files and comes with all of the standard controls one would expect.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [Dhall](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall-1.6.0),
an explicitly typed configuration language that is not Turing complete.
Despite being Turing incomplete, Dhall is a real programming language with a type-checker and evaluator.
