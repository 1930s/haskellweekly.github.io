-   [Let's make a GTK video player with Haskell](https://lettier.github.io/posts/2017-08-30-haskell-gtk-video-player.html)

    > We remade the application using the software libraries GTK+ and GStreamer. By using GTK+ and GStreamer, the application remains as portable as the Electron version. Movie Monad can now handle large video files and comes with all of the standard controls one would expect.

-   [Monads, monoids, and categories](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2017/09/06/monads-monoids-and-categories/)

    > There is no good place to end a book on category theory. There's always more to learn. Category theory is a vast subject. At the same time, it's obvious that the same themes, concepts, and patterns keep showing up over and over again.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [Dhall](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall-1.6.0),
an explicitly typed configuration language that is not Turing complete.
Despite being Turing incomplete, Dhall is a real programming language with a type-checker and evaluator.
