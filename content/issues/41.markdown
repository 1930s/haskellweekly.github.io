## News from the Haskell community

-   [Herculus beta: purely function spreadsheets]https://www.herculus.io)

    > Build rock-solid tools in no time and focus on the things that matter.

-   [Why prove programs equivalent when your compiler can do that for you?](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/717-Why_prove_programs_equivalent_when_your_compiler_can_do_that_for_you_)

    > I proved all the laws, but I was very unhappy. I have a PhD on something about Haskell and theorem proving. I have worked with Isabelle, Agda and Coq. Both Haskell and theorem proving is decades old. And yet, I sit here, and tediously write manual proofs by hand. Is this really the best we can do?

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [monad-metrics](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-metrics),
a convenient wrapper around EKG metrics.
