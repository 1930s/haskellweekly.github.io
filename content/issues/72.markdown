Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Haskell study startup](https://github.com/sjsyrek/haskell-study-startup)

    > Learning Haskell is a good idea, but you don't have to do it alone. This repo brings together a number of resources for people who would like to start their own Haskell study groups but aren't sure how to do it. Included here is advice for publicizing your group, guidelines for participants, a recommended schedule, and other resources.

-   [Coxswain: A type checker plugin for row types](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Plugins/TypeChecker/RowTypes/Coxswain?version=5)

    > I've been recently developing a Coxswain library that defines row types and implements row unification. I think the Haskell community is hungry for row types, especially records and variants. This wiki page outlines the basic design and intended use of the library, use cases I envision, and my open questions.

-   [All about strictness](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/09/all-about-strictness)

    > This blog post was inspired by some questions around writing efficient Conduit code, so I'll try to address some of that directly at the end. The concepts, though, are general, and will transfer to not only other streaming libraries, but non-streaming data libraries too.

-   [Migrating from RethinkDB to Postgres: An experience report](https://medium.com/fuzzy-sharp/migrating-to-postgres-2dc1519a6dc7)

    > We switched from RethinkDB and ElasticSearch to Postgres, leaning heavily on Haskell in order to fill in some of the gaps quickly. The project was a success, and we're very happy with the switch. Haskell has been invaluable for refactoring safely and confidently.

-   [Benchmarks: GHCJS (Reflex, Miso) & Purescript (Pux, Thermite, Halogen)](https://medium.com/@saurabhnanda/benchmarks-fp-languages-libraries-for-front-end-development-a11af0542f7e)

    > Once we were over the infamous Haskell learning curve, we began looking for functional programming, immutability, and types everywhere! Given that one-third of our code runs in the browser, it is only a matter of time before we make the switch to typed FP for front end development as well. But, which language/framework/library should we use?
