Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org) is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

-   [GHC 8.2.1 release candidate 2](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2017-May/014197.html)

    > The GHC team is very pleased to announce the second candidate of the 8.2.1 release of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. Source and binary distributions are available. This is the second of what will likely be either two or three release candidates leading up the final 8.2.1 release.

-   [Testing GHC release candidates with Stack](http://taylor.fausak.me/2017/05/17/testing-ghc-release-candidates-with-stack/)

    > Using the new compiler or interpreter directly is easy enough, but what about building an entire project? How can a Haskell developer test their code with the latest release candidate? Iâ€™m going to show you how to use Stack to do just that.

-   [The Haskell Cabal and cross compilation](https://medium.com/@zw3rk/the-haskell-cabal-and-cross-compilation-e9885fd5e2f)

    > Over the last few days we set up the Raspberry Pi, built the Raspbian SDK and the Haskell cross compiler. Today we will look at what Cabal is, and how to use it for cross compilation.

    zw3rk also published their [cross compilation survey results](https://medium.com/@zw3rk/cross-compilation-survey-results-3988ad1b677b) recently.

-   [INLIN(E)ing: a case study](https://mpickering.github.io/posts/2017-05-17-inlining-case-study.html)

    > It turned out that a misplaced INLINE pragma was causing a lot of simplification work to be duplicated. Removing the pragma allowed the compiler to operate faster whilst producing the same code.

-   [Haskell Bits #5: Easily working with JSON](http://www.kovach.me/posts/2017-05-11-easy-json.html)

    > JSON is ubiquitous nowadays, perhaps most importantly for web APIs. We'll probably need to interact with (or build) one of those at some point, so we must be able to handle JSON in Haskell, right? Yep --- also it's pretty easy. Let's talk about it!
