-   [Try Backpack: `ghc --backpack`](http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/10/try-backpack-ghc-backpack/)

-   [Haskell eXchange 2016 skillscasts](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7276-haskell-exchange-2016#skillscasts)

    > In its fifth year, the Haskell eXchange is an annual conference created for and by the Skills Matter community. An opportunity for Haskellers to meet, learn and share skills, discover emerging technologies and help evolve the Haskell ecosystem.

-   [Thoughts on Haskell](http://get-finch.com/2016/09/26/thoughts_on_haskell.html)

    > After spending most of a year doing Elm I have now been doing Haskell for a few weeks. I wanted to share my first impressions after about a month of Haskell. I have to say that compared to Elm I have been rather frustrated. I think the experience for new users in Haskell involves a much steeper learning curve than is needed.

-   [dataHaskell: Data types for data science](http://www.datahaskell.org)

    > Data science should be data driven with a strong focus on types. Our aim is to bring powerful tools to the best language for this task: Haskell.
