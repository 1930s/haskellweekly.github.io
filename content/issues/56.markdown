Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org) is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

-   [Accepted projects for 2017](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2017-05-24-accepted-projects.html)

    > We are happy to announce the 15 projects accepted for Summer of Haskell 2017 and that the community bonding period has begun.

-   [Escaping hell with monads](https://philipnilsson.github.io/Badness10k/posts/2017-05-07-escaping-hell-with-monads.html)

    > As programmers we occasionally find ourselves in "Programmer's Hell", where our regular abstractions fail to satisfactory solve certain recurrent problems. In this post we'll have a look at some instances of such situations, their "ad hoc" solutions provided at the language level, and finally at how these problems can be solved in a uniform way using monads.
