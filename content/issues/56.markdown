Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org) is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

-   [Accepted projects for 2017](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2017-05-24-accepted-projects.html)

    > We are happy to announce the 15 projects accepted for Summer of Haskell 2017 and that the community bonding period has begun.

-   [Escaping hell with monads](https://philipnilsson.github.io/Badness10k/posts/2017-05-07-escaping-hell-with-monads.html)

    > As programmers we occasionally find ourselves in "Programmer's Hell", where our regular abstractions fail to satisfactory solve certain recurrent problems. In this post we'll have a look at some instances of such situations, their "ad hoc" solutions provided at the language level, and finally at how these problems can be solved in a uniform way using monads.

-   [Cross compiling Template Haskell](https://medium.com/@zw3rk/cross-compiling-template-haskell-7e38c00c2914)

    > As laid out yesterday, there are some interesting questions pertaining to Template Haskell and cross compilation. Today we will put all the pieces together and cross compile Template Haskell to our Raspberry Pi with file and process IO!

-   [Type class patterns and anti-patterns](https://hackernoon.com/type-class-patterns-and-anti-patterns-efd045c5af66)

    > In a prior post I wrote about how type class instance selection worked. To help get a sense of good type class design, I want to walk through a type class pattern and a related type class anti-pattern.

-   [Numbers of every shape and size](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2017/5/22/numbers-of-every-shape-and-size)

    > Last week we explored the many different string types in Haskell. But this isn't the only situation where we seem to have an abundance of similar types. We can also see this in Haskell's numeric types. Again, we have the issue that we often want to represent numbers in slightly different ways.
