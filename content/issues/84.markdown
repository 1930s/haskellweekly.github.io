-   [Stack 1.6.1](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/haskell-stack/pRZAMkBlx8U/LrDrGPB8AAAJ)

    Stack, a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects, released version 1.6.1.

-   [Reflecting on Haskell in 2017](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/haskell_2018.html)

    > Haskell has had a great year and 2017 was defined by vast quantities of new code, including 14,000 new Haskell projects on Github. The amount of writing this year was voluminous and my list of interesting work is eight times as large as last year.

-   [Stack and nightly breakage](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/12/stack-and-nightly-breakage)

    > I'm sure a number of readers have already seen something about the situation around Stack and Stackage Nightly/GHC 8.2. I tried to clarify how this happened on the relevant Github issue, plus the GHC Trac ticket, but thought I'd reshare as a blog post for others who are interested.

-   [Pure functional validation in a nutshell](https://medium.com/blacklane-engineering/pure-functional-validation-64a7885d22ac)

    > Why should you care about typed, functional programming? The data validation example sort of makes the point on its own: if you care about validating the data that users input into your forms, why shouldn't you care just as much about the data that gets input into your functions?

-   [1 year of Haskell](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2017/12/4/1-year-of-haskell)

    > This week marks the one year anniversary of Monday Morning Haskell! I've written an awful lot in the past year.

-   [Making two garbage collectors be good neighbors (using linear types)](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2017-11-29-linear-jvm.html)

    > When two garbaged-collected languages share references to the same values, each garbage collector (GC) needs to be careful to not collect these values while the other language has references to them.
