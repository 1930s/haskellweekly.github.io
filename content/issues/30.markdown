-   [Clean alternatives with MaybeT](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2016/11/18/clean_alternatives_with_maybet.html)

    > The Monad instance for Maybe covers a common case: given some sequence of functions which may fail, we want to try them all and if any of them fail then we'll short circuit it all. However, that's not the only case. Very often, you'll want to take the first thing that succeeds, rather than failing unless everything works.

-   ["Hello, World" with PureScript C++](http://andyarvanitis.com/hello-world-purescript-cpp/)

    > This is a short-as-possible demonstration of using PureScript's C++11 backend (a.k.a. pure11) to build a native command-line application.
