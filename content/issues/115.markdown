-   [Thinkster's RealWorld backend](https://siskam.link/2018-07-02-thinkster-s-realworld---backend.html)

    > My first try implement Thinkster's Conduit API can be found at RealWorldTM which I think should be fully functional. But, it doesn't feel right if I don't write it up. So, here we go again.
