## News from the Haskell community

-   [GHC 8.0.2 is available!](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/blog/ghc-8.0.2-released)

    > The GHC team is happy to at last announce the 8.0.2 release of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. This is the second release of the 8.0 series and fixes nearly two-hundred bugs. This release is the result of six months of effort by the GHC development community.

-   [Fast Haskell: Competing with C at parsing XML](http://chrisdone.com/posts/fast-haskell-c-parsing-xml)

    > In this post we're going to look at parsing XML in Haskell, how it compares with an efficient C parser, and steps you can take in Haskell to build a fast library from the ground up. We're going to get fairly detailed and get our hands dirty.

-   [An interview with Haskell developer Edward Kmett](https://theinitialcommit.com/2017/01/10/edward-kmett/)

    > For the most part I look for something that should exist for some deep underlying mathematical reason that doesn't yet exist in code in a reusable form and try to figure out how to bring it about.

-   [Linearity, uniqueness, and Haskell](http://edsko.net/2017/01/08/linearity-in-haskell/)

    > There is a group of people working on a proposal for adding linear types to Haskell. In this blog post I will attempt to put this proposal in some context. I will explain what linearity is and how it relates to its close cousin uniqueness typing, and I will compare the proposal to some other ways of doing things. My hope is that this will make the work more accessible.
