## Featured

-   [Typesafe, Polymorphic, Parallel Map Algebra in Haskell](https://www.fosskers.ca/blog/mapalgebra-en.html)

    > Repeated, sequential operations over large imagery have been a thorn in the side of Raster processing systems for a long time. The new library `mapalgebra` leverages the Array library `massiv` to bring rigour and efficiency back to GIS, outperforming similar libraries in the field written in C and Scala.

-   [Cloning FluxBB](https://siskam.link/2018-04-14-cloning-fluxbb.html)

    > Writing a forum software is one of a few things that I-wish-I-had-but-hadn't in the last of couple of years. For example, among a gazillion of abandoned repos on this GitLab account, `Forum` is one of them. If you take a glance of it, you will see that it's an unfinished forum software. So, I decided to take a different approach to finally do it, no matter what it takes.
