Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Survey

The second annual [state of Haskell survey](https://airtable.com/shr8G4RBPD9T6tnDf)
started last week on the 1st and continues until the 15th.
More than 2,800 people filled out the survey already.
If you already filled it out:
Thank you!
Please share it so we can get a good picture of the Haskell community.
If you have not filled it out yet:
We want to hear from you!
Please take a few minutes to fill it out.

## Featured

-   [Hakyll part 1: Setup & initial customization](https://robertwpearce.com/hakyll-pt-1-setup-and-initial-customization.html) by Robert Pearce

    > First post in a series on making & customizing a static site with Hakyll.

-   [Exceptionally monadic error handling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13430) by Jan Malakhovski

    > We notice that the type of `catch :: c a -> (e -> c a) -> c a` operator is a special case of monadic bind operator `(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b` and the semantic (surprisingly) matches.

-   [Lambda the Ultimate pattern factory](https://github.com/thma/LtuPatternFactory/tree/1be9521591f8a7f06b35a7ae5929e7beaf0b8e43) by Thomas Mahler

    > Recently, while re-reading through the Typeclassopedia I thought it would be a good exercise to map the structure of software design-patterns to the concepts found in the Haskell type class library and in functional programming in general.
