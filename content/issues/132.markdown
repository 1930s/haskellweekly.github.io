Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Survey

The second annual [state of Haskell survey](https://airtable.com/shr8G4RBPD9T6tnDf)
started last week on the 1st and continues until the 15th.
More than 2,800 people filled out the survey already.
If you already filled it out:
Thank you!
Please share it so we can get a good picture of the Haskell community.
If you have not filled it out yet:
We want to hear from you!
Please take a few minutes to fill it out.
