## News from the Haskell community

-   [GHC 8.0.2 on Stackage Nightly. Here's the LTS plan.](https://lwm.github.io/stackage-8.0.2/)

    > GHC 8.0.2 has been released! A big congratulations to everyone who was involved. Accordingly, the Stackage curators teams has been quickly able to cut a new nightly release which supports GHC 8.0.2. Thanks to the efforts of the package authors and Stackage maintainers so far!

-   [Fun with hint](http://kseo.github.io//posts/2017-01-19-fun-with-hint.html)

    > GHC allows us to compile and execute Haskell code dynamically through GHC API. The hint library provides a Haskell interpreter built on top of GHC API. It allows us to load and execute Haskell expressions and even coerce them into values.

-   [The monad fear](https://e.xtendo.org/monad)

    > Just call them "IO action" or "IO type", and explain they are similar to Unix commands, and there will be nothing more to teach. But we call them IO monads and cause this chaos. "How do I deal with a sequence of multiple numbers in Haskell?" "Use List." No one replies with "Use the List monad" unless they're pure evil!
