-   [Sharing, memory leaks, and Conduit and friends](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2016/09/sharing-conduit/)

    > Sharing conduit values leads to memory leaks. Make sure to disable the full laziness optimization in the module with your top-level calls to `runConduit` or (`$$`). Similar considerations apply to other streaming libraries and indeed any Haskell code that uses lazy data structures to drive computation.

-   [Updated Hackage mirroring](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/09/updated-hackage-mirroring)

    > With the addition of the new hackage-security metadata files to our S3 mirror, one nice benefit is that the FP Complete mirror is now an official Hackage mirror, and can be used natively by cabal-install without having to modify any configuration files.
