-   [Introducing the Hamilton library](https://blog.jle.im/entry/introducing-the-hamilton-library.html)

    > The hamilton library is on Hackage! It was mostly a proof-of-concept toy experiment to simulate motion on Bezier curves, but it became usable enough and accurate enough (to my surprise, admittedly) that I finished up some final touches to make it complete and put it on Hackage as a general-purpose physics simulator.

-   [Scaling ghc --make](http://trofi.github.io/posts/193-scaling-ghc-make.html)

    > The problem is that even on my machine `ghc --make -j3` works better than `ghc --make -j8` and I could not get more than 1.5x speedup. Iâ€™d like to see 8x speedup. Another problem is quick performance degradation once you exceed number of CPUs. Running `ghc --make -j20` on my machine makes things seriously worse: compilation time is longer than in non-parallel mode!

-   [Golang's real-time GC in theory and practice](https://blog.pusher.com/golangs-real-time-gc-in-theory-and-practice/)

    > The system we have been building is a pub/sub message bus with an in-memory store of published messages. This version in Go is a rewrite of our first implementation in Haskell. We stopped work on our Haskell version in May, after discovering fundamental latency problems with GHC's garbage collector.

-   [24 days of PureScript](https://github.com/paf31/24-days-of-purescript-2016)

    > Two years ago, I wrote a series of blog posts inspired by Oliver Charles' 24 Days of Hackage, to highlight some of the great work which was being done in the PureScript community. That original series focused on library development, but this year I've decided to write a series of short blog posts to highlight some of the work being done on the compiler itself.
