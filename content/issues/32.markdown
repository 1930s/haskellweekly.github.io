-   [Golang's real-time GC in theory and practice](https://blog.pusher.com/golangs-real-time-gc-in-theory-and-practice/)

    > The system we have been building is a pub/sub message bus with an in-memory store of published messages. This version in Go is a rewrite of our first implementation in Haskell. We stopped work on our Haskell version in May, after discovering fundamental latency problems with GHC's garbage collector.
