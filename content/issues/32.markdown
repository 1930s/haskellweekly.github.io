    > The hamilton library is on Hackage! It was mostly a proof-of-concept toy experiment to simulate motion on Bezier curves, but it became usable enough and accurate enough (to my surprise, admittedly) that I finished up some final touches to make it complete and put it on Hackage as a general-purpose physics simulator.

    > The system we have been building is a pub/sub message bus with an in-memory store of published messages. This version in Go is a rewrite of our first implementation in Haskell. We stopped work on our Haskell version in May, after discovering fundamental latency problems with GHC's garbage collector.
