Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [GHC 8.2.1 release candidate 3 available](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2017-July/014364.html)

    > This release candidate fixes a number of regressions from 8.0.2 found in release candidate 2, as well as a major correctness bug present in several previous GHC major releases. Users taking advantage of parallelism in their programs will be strongly encouraged to upgrade to 8.2.1 once it is released.

    Editor's note: Use [this `stack.yaml`](https://gist.github.com/tfausak/623d283cfe7a338bcbfca56ddfec0ecd/cc31f363737a40d297af934f813730b022fdfd64) to test GHC 8.2.1-rc3 with Stack.

-   [Stack's new extensible snapshots](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/07/stacks-new-extensible-snapshots)

    > There is a collection of features in Stack that have been added in bit by bit, as opposed to being designed into a cohesive whole from the start. The features work, but could be a bit better. We've known for a while that, instead of putting in place strategic fixes, a more general refactoring of the core dependency management logic was in order.

-   [Front Row is hiring a senior backend Haskell engineer](https://frontrow.workable.com/j/463B843754) (ad)

    > Come change how 6.5+ million K-12 US students learn Math, Language Arts, Social Studies and more. Use data, advanced type systems, great product design and deep pedagogy to change lives.
