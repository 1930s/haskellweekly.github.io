## Featured

-   [Finite-state machines part 2: Explicit typed state transitions](https://wickstrom.tech/finite-state-machines/2017/11/19/finite-state-machines-part-2.html)

    > Using a sort of extended MTL style, with conventions for state machine encodings, gives us more type safety in state transitions. Abstract state values, impossible to create outside the instance, are now passed explicitly in state transitions.
