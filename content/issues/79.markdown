-   [GHC 8.2.2 release candidate 2](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2017-October/014994.html)

    > The GHC team is very pleased to announce the second candidate of the 8.2.2 release of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. This is the second and hopefully last of two release candidates leading up the final 8.2.2 release.

    Editor's note: Use [this `stack.yaml`](https://gist.github.com/tfausak/e60fe3fa93344c747ac38891fa55a0db/413b18b84a78ee10b48bfbb4adf898ff56d7e55d) to easily test GHC 8.2.2-rc2 with Stack.

-   [Persistent red-black trees in Haskell](https://abhiroop.github.io/Haskell-Red-Black-Tree/)

    > While Haskell is steadily gaining mainstream adoption in the industry, it still remains one of the most viable languages used as a teaching medium. In this post we will be looking at the construction and operations of red-black trees. Of special interest here would be the deletion of nodes, as the operation of delete is inherently opposed to Haskell's fundamentals of immutability.

-   [Motor: Finite-state machines in Haskell](https://wickstrom.tech/programming/2017/10/27/motor-finite-state-machines-haskell.html)

    > While writing my talk "Finite-state machines? Your compiler wants in!", I have worked on porting the Idris ST library to Haskell. I call it Motor. Motor is an experimental Haskell library for building finite-state machines with type-safe transitions and effects.

-   [Pandoc 2.0](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.0)

    This is such a massive release to the universal markup converter that it's hard to summarize. Tons of new features, changes, fixes, and improvements.

-   [Building GHC: The package database](https://medium.com/@zw3rk/building-ghc-the-package-database-50c37cf6ce33)

    > While we usually build packages for use with GHC via `cabal`, the packages GHC knows about are those registered in the known package database. The global package database usually resides next to the `ghc` binary and is called `package.conf.d`.

-   [Contributing to GHC](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/10/29/contributing_to_ghc.html)

    > This post serves as notes and explorations of my first patch to GHC. I'm going to start from the very beginning --- so it might be kind of boring!

-   [Dueling rhetoric of Clojure and Haskell](http://tech.frontrowed.com/2017/11/01/rhetoric-of-clojure-and-haskell/)

    > Recently Lispcast wrote a post interpreting Rich Hickey's controversial statements on static types. This post had some very interesting perspectives and some unfortunate misinformation.

-   [Short `ByteString` and `Text`](https://markkarpov.com/post/short-bs-and-text.html)

    > There are other under-appreciated types and libraries that complement `ByteString` and `Text`. These may be a better choice in some circumstances, but I believe many Haskellers are not aware of them. This post aims to rectify that.

-   [The exodus to Streamgard, an epic poem](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2017-11-01-streaming-and-foldl.html)

    > The Serpent will assemble its minions, Early-close and Strictness of effects, and unleash its wrath upon our world. Foldl, son of Haskell and brother of Foldr, would lead humanity to its last bastion, Streamgard, and organize the final fight...

-   [New fintech startup hiring 1-2 Haskell backend engineers](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/79ri32/new_fintech_startup_hiring_12_haskell_backend/)

    > Mercury is hiring 1-2 backend engineers to join our stealth B2B fintech startup. Since we're a new startup, you'll be shaping our backend codebase.
