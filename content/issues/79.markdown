-   [Persistent red-black trees in Haskell](https://abhiroop.github.io/Haskell-Red-Black-Tree/)

    > While Haskell is steadily gaining mainstream adoption in the industry, it still remains one of the most viable languages used as a teaching medium.

Of special interest here would be the deletion of nodes, as the operation of delete is inherently opposed to Haskell's fundamentals of immutability.
