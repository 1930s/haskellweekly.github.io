Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Typed Functional Programming and Software Correctness](https://dimjasevic.net/marko/2018/10/23/typed-functional-programming-and-software-correctness/)

    > In this post I‚Äôll explain why functional programming and static type systems are important for software correctness.

## Jobs

-   [Careers at Galois](https://galois.com/careers/)

    > Galois is growing and hiring Technical Project Leads, Software Engineers/Researchers, and Principal Scientists for all three of our locations (Portland, OR/Arlington, VA/Dayton, OH). Galwegians apply cutting edge computer science and mathematics to advance the state of the art in software and hardware trustworthiness. Engineers work in small team settings and must successfully interact with clients, partners, and other employees in a highly cooperative and intellectually challenging environment. Creativity thrives in a work environment that respects employees' quality-of-life.

## In brief

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [Toodles](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/toodles-0.1.0.11),
an application for managing `TODO` entries in your code.
It scrapes your entire repository for TODO entries and organizes them so you can manage your project directly from the code.

## Call for participation
