## News from the Haskell community

-   [Brent Yorgey's new programming languages course](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2017/01/13/my-new-programming-languages-course/)

    > My new PL course is now finished, and all the course materials are freely available. Working through all the exercises should be a great option for anyone wishing to learn some basics of programming language design and implementation.

-   [Expressive types, not oppressive types](https://literateprogrammer.blogspot.com.au/2017/01/expressive-types-not-oppressive-types.html)

    > Uncle Bob looks at advanced type systems and sees them as more oppressive rather than more expressive. Being able to describe whether or not a function can return null is an opportunity, not a constraint.

-   [LiquidHaskell](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/)

    > LiquidHaskell (LH) refines Haskell's types with logical predicates that let you enforce critical properties at compile time.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [dump-core](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dump-core),
