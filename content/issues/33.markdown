-   [Haskell in the datacentre](http://simonmar.github.io/posts/2016-12-08-Haskell-in-the-datacentre.html)

    > At Facebook we run Haskell on thousands of servers, together handling over a million requests per second. Obviously we'd like to make the most efficient use of hardware and get the most throughput per server that we can. So how do you tune a Haskell-based server to run well?
