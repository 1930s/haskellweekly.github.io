## Featured

-   [Cellular Christmas tree](https://dodisturb.me/posts/2018-01-28-Cellular-Christmas-Tree.html)

    > In which we create a program displaying a Christmas tree from a single dot on an infinite tape using two cellular automata computed with comonads as used in Haskell. You can also call it yet another comonad tutorial if you like.

-   [Domain modeling with Haskell: Factoring out recursion](https://haskell-at-work.com/episodes/2018-02-11-domain-modelling-with-haskell-factoring-out-recursion.html)

    > In the final part of the "Domain modeling with Haskell" series we factor out recursion from the Project data type, and use Fixplate to traverse the tree and accumulate reports. Although a highly flexible and powerful technique, it should not be employed prematurely due to its more advanced nature.

-   [Humble Book Bundle: Functional Programming](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/functional-programming-books?partner=haskellweekly)

    > More awesome tech ebooks for you.  We've teamed up with Oâ€™Reilly for another bundle full of top-quality books! Get titles like Functional Thinking, Clojure Programming, Learning Scala, and Programming Rust. Plus, your purchase will support Code for America!
