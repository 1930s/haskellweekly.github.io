-   [Exceptions best practices in Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/11/exceptions-best-practices-haskell)

    > I consider the safe-exceptions library uncontroversial, simply addressing the reality of exceptions in GHC today. This blog post is the opinionated part: how I recommend you use exceptions in Haskell, and how to structure your code around them.
    
-   [Use MySQL safely in Yesod applications](http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2016/11/use-mysql-safely-in-yesod)

    > With the latest version of the mysql library, we now have the machinery needed to use it properly in a concurrent setting. In the past, any multi-threaded use was a little risky, although in practice it seems to have been satisfactory for applications which were not too demanding.
    
-   [Designing APIs for extensibility](http://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/11/designing-apis-for-extensibility)

    > Design your APIs from the outset to be extensible. There are common techniques employed in the Haskell world to make APIs that are resilient to changing feature-sets, and by employing them early on in your design process, you can hopefully avoid the painful choices between a better API and happy users.
