-   [GHC proposal: Linear types](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/91)

    > This proposal introduces a notion of linear function to GHC. Linear functions are regular functions that guarantee that they will use their argument exactly once. We propose a new language extension, `-XLinearTypes`.
