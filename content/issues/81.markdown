-   [2017 state of Haskell survey results](http://taylor.fausak.me/2017/11/15/2017-state-of-haskell-survey-results/)

    > I am excited to announce the results of the 2017 state of Haskell survey, published by Haskell Weekly! To the 1,335 people that responded to the survey: Thank you! I appreciate your feedback.

-   [GHC 8.2.2 release candidate 3](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2017-October/015036.html)

    > The GHC team is very pleased to announce the third candidate of the 8.2.2 release of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. This is the third and last of three release candidates leading up the final 8.2.2 release.

-   [Haskell Communities and Activities Report: 33rd edition](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2017-November/025300.html)

    > Many thanks go to all the people that contributed to this report, both directly, by sending in descriptions, and indirectly, by doing all the interesting things that are reported.

-   [GHC proposal: Linear types](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/91)

    > This proposal introduces a notion of linear function to GHC. Linear functions are regular functions that guarantee that they will use their argument exactly once. We propose a new language extension, `-XLinearTypes`.

-   [Hadrian is on the way](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/hadrian-is-on-the-way/)

    > Hadrian, a new build system for GHC that we have been working on for the past three years, has finally been merged into the GHC tree. However it's not yet time to celebrate --- there are still many issues that need to be addressed before the Make-based build system may retire.

-   [Finite-state machines part 1: Modeling with Haskell data types](https://wickstrom.tech/finite-state-machines/2017/11/10/finite-state-machines-part-1-modeling-with-haskell.html)

    > By teaching the type system about possible states and state transitions in our program, it can verify that we follow our own business rules, both when we write new code, and when we modify existing code.

-   [Conventional interfaces in functional programming](https://carlosmchica.github.io/conventional-interfaces/)

    > SICP describes conventional interfaces as a design principle for working with data structures. It is composed of a set of standard operators or combinators that connect the different steps required to implement computations in computer programs.

-   [Haskell theory exploration](http://chriswarbo.net/git/haskell-te/)

    > This repository provides commands for performing "theory exploration". Theory exploration describes the task of taking in some function definitions and outputting conjectures about those functions.

-   [Expression of interest: MDN style documentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7d0pn0/expression_of_interest_mdn_style_documentation/)

    > As a beginner, I've had many struggles learning Haskell, and a lot of that has been the lack of "reference" style documentation compared to "tutorial" style documentation.

-   [Dependent types in Haskell](https://haskell-serbia.com/tutorial/4)

    > Dependent types help to form a proof that the most critical features work the way we want them and all that in compile time. We can form specific set of types that will ensure all invariants program can have will work properly.
