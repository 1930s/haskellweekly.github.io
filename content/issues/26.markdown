-   [Showcasing Applicative](http://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/710-Showcasing_Applicative)

    > My plan for this week's lecture of the CIS 194 Haskell course at the University of Pennsylvania is to dwell a bit on the concept of Functor, Applicative and Monad, and to highlight the value of the Applicative abstraction.

-   [tensorflow-haskell](https://github.com/tensorflow/haskell)

    > The tensorflow-haskell package provides Haskell bindings to TensorFlow, an open source software library for machine intelligence.

-   [Grokking fix](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2016/10/26/grokking_fix.html)

    > Haskell's laziness enables some pretty cool tricks. The `fix` function is one of the neater ones, though it can be hard to understand how to use it from just the implementation and type signature. A fixed point of a function is some value where applying the function to the value returns the same value.
