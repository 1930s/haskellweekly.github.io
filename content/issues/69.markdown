## Featured

-   [Abusing Haskell dependent types to make Redis queues safer](https://medium.com/@zyxoas/abusing-haskell-dependent-types-to-make-redis-queues-safer-cc31db943b6c)

    > I don't know about you, but quite frankly I'm tired of seeing the same tired vector example being used to demonstrate why dependent types are useful.

-   [Backpack for deep learning](http://blog.ezyang.com/2017/08/backpack-for-deep-learning/)

    > Although there many different types of tensor,  the computations for each type of tensor are the same, i.e, they share the same interface. Since Backpack lets you program against one interface which can have multiple implementations, it is the perfect tool for implementing a tensor library.
