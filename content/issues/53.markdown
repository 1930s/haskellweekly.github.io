## News from the Haskell community

-   [I tried Haskell for 5 years and here's how it was](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2017/05/02/i-tried-haskell-for-5-years-and-heres-how-it-was/)

    > Haskell is a great programming language. It requires some effort at the beginning, but you get to learn a very different way of thinking about your problems. At the same time, the ecosystem matured significantly (hopefully signalling a trend) and the language can be great to work with.

-   [Stutter: the anti-grep](http://www.nmattia.com/posts/2017-05-01-release-stutter.html)

    > I'm going to introduce stutter, a command line tool for generating strings. I'll first show some examples, then talk a bit about the performance and finally about the implementation (for the Haskell friendly reader).

-   [Lifts for free: making mtl typeclasses derivable](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2017/04/28/lifts-for-free-making-mtl-typeclasses-derivable/)

    > While we cannot eliminate the instances entirely without somewhat dangerous techniques like overlapping instances, we can automatically derive them using features of modern GHC, eliminating the truly unnecessary boilerplate.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [Chart](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Chart),
