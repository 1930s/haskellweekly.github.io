## News from the Haskell community

-   [I tried Haskell for 5 years and here's how it was](https://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2017/05/02/i-tried-haskell-for-5-years-and-heres-how-it-was/)

    > Haskell is a great programming language. It requires some effort at the beginning, but you get to learn a very different way of thinking about your problems. At the same time, the ecosystem matured significantly (hopefully signalling a trend) and the language can be great to work with.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [Chart](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Chart),
a library for generating 2D charts and plots.
