## News from the Haskell community

-   [Efficient CStruct](http://tab.snarc.org/posts/haskell/2017-03-20-compilation-cstruct.html)

    > Dealing with complex C-structure-like data in haskell often forces the developer to have to deal with C files, and create a system that is usually a tradeoff between efficiency, modularity and safety. The `Foreign` class doesn't quite cut it, external program needs C files, and binary parsers are not efficient or modular. Let's see if we can do better using the advanced haskell type system.
