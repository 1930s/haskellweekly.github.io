Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on correctness, productivity, and expressiveness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [GHC 8.2.1 released](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/blog/ghc-8.2.11-released)

    > The GHC developers are very happy to announce the long-awaited 8.2.1 release of Glasgow Haskell Compiler. This is the second release in the 8.0 series. As such, the focus of this release is performance, stability, and consolidation.

-   [Announcing Eta v0.1 developer preview](https://medium.com/eta-programming-language/announcing-eta-0-1-developer-preview-65b6c1838c6)

    > Today, we're excited to release the developer preview of Eta which features the first binary release. The focus for this series will be bug fixes, documentation updates, performance improvements, and standard library changes.

-   [The `RIO` monad](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/07/the-rio-monad)

    > I've played with the idea of a `RIO` (`Reader` + `IO`) monad a number of times in the past, but never bit the bullet to do it. As I've been hashing out ideas with some people and working through cleanups on Stack, it became clear that the time was right to try this out.

-   [Building inline-c projects just got a lot easier](http://mazzo.li/posts/new-inline-c.html)

    > The latest version of inline-c, 0.6.0.0, does not require manual specification of generated C files. Moreover, GHCi now works, provided you use `-fobject-code`. The build process as a whole is much more reliable.

-   [Lens tutorial: `SimpleLens`](http://www.mchaver.com/posts/2017-07-12-lens-tutorial-1.html)

    > We may not need all of the tools from the `lens` package. I believe the best way to start using lenses is Haskell is by implementing a simple subset.

-   [Homegrown linear monads with `RebindableSyntax`](https://m0ar.github.io/safe-streaming/2017/07/20/homegrown-linear-monads.html)

    > A linear monad class would allow relying on the type system to ensure that a monadic value can only be used once by forcing the bind to consume its first argument (disallowing multiple uses of earlier stream references), effectively making the previously shown runtime errors impossible.

## Jobs

-   [Facebook: Software Engineer, Static Analysis](https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/a0I1200000LT8aAEAT/)

    > Facebook's Static Analysis team is seeking an experienced software engineer with expertise in C++ and typed functional programming to help build and improve our analysis tools. You will help design and extend Infer for C++, which is used to find bugs across all Facebook engineering.
