-   [Haskell package checklist](http://taylor.fausak.me/2016/12/05/haskell-package-checklist/)

    > This post covers everything you need to know about developing a Haskell package. I wrote it because I made a few packages and nothing covers the entire process.

-   [Haskell pitfalls](http://lorepub.com/post/2016-12-17-Haskell-Pitfalls)

    > Mark Wotton and Chris Allen were discussing some of the newbie traps in the Haskell ecosystem, particularly in libraries. Theyâ€™re a recurring topic for us and we finally decided to round some of the more common ones up into a list. Hopefully this prevents some pain in the future.

-   [Beware of `readFile`](http://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/12/beware-of-readfile)

    > This behavior is very clearly documented in System.IO, namely that GHC will follow system-specific rules to determine the appropriate character encoding rules, and open up Handles with that character encoding set. However, I'm also going to claim the following: In exactly 0 cases in my Haskell career have I desired the character encoding guessing functionality of the textual readFile functions.

-   [Setting up a Haskell development environment](http://www.prigrammer.com/?p=332)

    > In this post, I'm going to go through step by step how to set up a Haskell development environment using Stack (a Haskell build tool), GHC, ghc-mod and other wonderful Haskell tools, and integrating all this with the Atom editor.
