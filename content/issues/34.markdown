-   [Haskell package checklist](http://taylor.fausak.me/2016/12/05/haskell-package-checklist/)

    > This post covers everything you need to know about developing a Haskell package. I wrote it because I made a few packages and nothing covers the entire process.

-   [Haskell pitfalls](http://lorepub.com/post/2016-12-17-Haskell-Pitfalls)

    > Mark Wotton and Chris Allen were discussing some of the newbie traps in the Haskell ecosystem, particularly in libraries. Theyâ€™re a recurring topic for us and we finally decided to round some of the more common ones up into a list. Hopefully this prevents some pain in the future.
