## Featured

-   [scalendar: Time management in Haskell](https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/scalendar-time-management-in-haskell)

    > This is the kind of problem that scalendar approaches --- namely, managing availability over time for a set of identifiers (which represent resources), where the availability varies according to the state of a calendar that is affected by the history of reservations previously performed.

## Jobs

-   [Haskell Full Stack Developer](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/156727/haskell-full-stack-developer-scrive) (ad)

    > We need someone with a strong Haskell background to help maintain and develop new features across our PostgreSQL-Haskell-React stack. We have a stable backend written in Haskell, that interfaces with PostgreSQL using hpqtypes, with a dash of Java for manipulating PDFs. Scrive is the Nordic market-leading provider of electronic signatures.
