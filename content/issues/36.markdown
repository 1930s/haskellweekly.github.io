## News from the Haskell community

-   [Automatically export Haskell modules](http://taylor.fausak.me/2016/12/30/automatically-export-haskell-modules/)

    > You will often see top-level modules like Data.Time that simply re-export modules below them in the hierarchy. Doing this by hand is tedious and error-prone. Autoexporter does this tedious work for you.

## Package of the week

For the first time ever, Haskell Weekly is picking a package of the week!
The package of this week is [Rapid](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rapid), a helper library for rapid prototyping in GHCi sessions.
