Welcome to the first issue of Haskell Weekly in 2017!
[Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org/) is an advanced, purely functional programming language.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.
You can subscribe to [the email newsletter](https://news.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=49a6a2e17b12be2c5c4dcb232&id=ffbbbbd930) or [the Atom feed](/haskell-weekly.atom).

## News from the Haskell community

-   [Formation of the initial GHC Steering Committee](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2017-January/013505.html)

    > Over the past months we have discussed changes to GHC's process for collecting, discussing, and considering new language extensions, compiler features, and the like. We have formed the GHC Steering Committee which will be responsible for evaluating the proposals that run through the process.

-   [Rascal: a Haskell with more parentheses](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2017/01/02/rascal-a-haskell-with-more-parentheses/)

    > So, let's assume that we do want Haskell's strong type system and that we also want a powerful metaprogramming model that permits syntactic extensions. What would that look like?

-   [Automatically export Haskell modules](http://taylor.fausak.me/2016/12/30/automatically-export-haskell-modules/)

    > You will often see top-level modules like Data.Time that simply re-export modules below them in the hierarchy. Doing this by hand is tedious and error-prone. Autoexporter does this tedious work for you.

## Package of the week

For the first time ever, Haskell Weekly is picking a package of the week!
The package of this week is [Rapid](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rapid), a helper library for rapid prototyping in GHCi sessions.
