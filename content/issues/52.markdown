## News from the Haskell community

-   [Student applications are now open](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2017-04-25-student-applications-open.html)

    > We are now happy to announce that we have opened student applications for Summer of Haskell 2017. The application period is open until the 6th of May, so that should give you plenty of time. At this time, we are also actively seeking mentors. In case you would like to mentor a project, please let us know. Thanks to the generous donations of our sponsors, we will be able to sponsor around 10 students this year.

-   [BayHac 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5lgjzYOvyYNchlkMzvDqd1F6gS-COCDo)

    Presentations by Julie Moronuki, John Wiegley, RÃºnar Bjarnason, Gabriel Gonzalez, Chris Smith, Doug Beardsley, James Bowen, Luite Stegeman, Greg Hale, Tikhon Jelvis, Dimitri DeFigueiredo, Adelbert Chang, John Leo, Judah Jacobson, Frederick Mayle, and Sandy Maguire.

-   [Become a curator](https://github.com/fpco/stackage/blob/8b9d77980df221f393580438bedb9787f50922fc/become-a-curator.md)

    > We are looking to expand the stackage curator team! As a Stackage curator you will help the community by curating and publishing the widely used nightly and LTS snapshots: Collections of packages that are guaranteed to play well together. All curators are volunteers.

-   [The water jug problem in Hedgehog](http://clrnd.com.ar/posts/2017-04-21-the-water-jug-problem-in-hedgehog.html)

    > Let's try Hedgehog with the water jug problem. You have 2 water jugs that you can either fill or empty. One has 5 litter capacity and the other 3. You win by leaving 4 litters in the big one.

-   [Veggies: Haskell code generation from scratch](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/719-veggies__Haskell_code_generation_from_scratch)

    > To make that goal of a formally verified compiler more feasible, I set out and implemented code generation from GHC's intermediate language Core to LLVM IR, with simplicity as the main design driving factor.

-   [Haskell success stories](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/04/haskell-success-stories)

    > I think we have a problem in the Haskell community. We all know that using Haskell to create a simple web service, a CRUD app, a statically linked command line tool, or a dozen other things is not only possible, but commonplace, trivial, and not even noteworthy.
