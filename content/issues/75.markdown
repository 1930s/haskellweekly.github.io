Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [GHC 8.2.2 release candidate 1](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2017-October/014777.html)

    > The GHC team is very pleased to announce the first candidate of the 8.2.2 release of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. This is the first of two release candidates leading up the final 8.2.2 release.

    Editor's note: Use [this `stack.yaml`](https://gist.github.com/tfausak/640a1b27252bfce33f1f2229d39781f5/8f70d7ccc38ee5854f7c8dfe19aea3c1be581a03) to easily test GHC 8.2.2-rc1 with Stack.

-   [A tale of two monads: Free vs MTL](http://tech.frontrowed.com/2017/09/28/benching-free/)

    > Much has been said about the benefits of `Free` monads. The idea of expressing computation as a data type is very powerful. Separating interpretation from representation gives us a lot of freedom, but what are its costs?

-   ["Category Theory for Programmers" PDF](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/73e7l3/i_made_bartosz_milewskis_book_category_theory_for/)

    > I took it upon myself to try and convert this work into a PDF, and with his permission, so I have! I scraped the blog, converted it to LaTeX using Pandoc, and manually tweaked a whole bunch of things. The result is one beautifully-typeset PDF, if I say so myself.

-   [Building a CPU with Haskell](https://yager.io/CPU/CPU1.html)

    > The fact that we're writing this CPU in Haskell instead of in an HDL like Verilog means that there will be substantial stylistic differences from how CPUs are normally written. However, almost all of these differences make it vastly simpler and faster to write hardware.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [ghcid](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcid-0.6.7),
a bare bones IDE.
It is a very simple Haskell development tool which shows you the errors in your project and updates them whenever you save.
