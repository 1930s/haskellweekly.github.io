Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://haskell-lang.org) is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

-   [Realizing Hackett, a metaprogrammable Haskell](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2017/05/27/realizing-hackett-a-metaprogrammable-haskell/)

    > Almost five months ago, I wrote a blog post about my new programming language, Hackett, a fanciful sketch of a programming language from a far-off land with Haskell's type system and Racket's macros. [...] Hackett is not only real, it's working, and you can try it out yourself!

-   [Wire is hiring a Software Backend Developer (Operations) in Berlin, Germany](https://wire.softgarden.io/job/1022464?l=en) (ad)

    > Wire is an open source, end-to-end encrypted messenger for personal and business use. For our development center in Berlin we are hiring two Backend Haskell Developers.
