## Featured

-   [Call for haskell.org committee nominations](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2017-October/128060.html)

    > It is time to put out a call for new nominations (typically but not necessarily self-nominations) to the haskell.org committee. The Haskell.org committee serves as a board of directors for Haskell.org, a 501(c)3 nonprofit which oversees technical and financial resources related to Haskell community infrastructure.

-   [Stack 1.6 pre-release testing and binaries](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/haskell-stack/SEvMu1yymWk/phVkkc9VBwAJ)

    > There have been some major changes to Stack's internals since version 1.5.1 in order to update the `package` and `extra-deps` syntax, support extensible custom snapshots, and to support version 2.0 of the Cabal library. We'd appreciate extra testing before we cut a release candidate for version 1.6 to make sure we catch any edge cases.

## Jobs

-   [Tenure-track assistant professor of Computer Science](https://www.calstatela.edu/2018/college-engineering-computer-science-technology/ecst-cs-ttf)

    > California State University, Los Angeles is looking for a tenure-track assistant professor of Computer Science to start in August 2018. The primary professional responsibilities of instructional faculty members are: teaching, research, scholarship and/or creative activity, and service to the University, profession and to the community.
