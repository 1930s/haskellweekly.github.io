- [cabal new-build is a package manager](http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/08/cabal-new-build-is-a-package-manager/)

  > An old article I occasionally see cited today is Repeat after me: "Cabal is not a Package Manager". Many of the complaints don't apply to cabal-install 1.24's new Nix-style local builds.

- [Shareable APIs and more](https://www.spock.li/2016/08/25/shareable-apis.html)

  > If you are already using the same language, I think calling an endpoint from the frontend should rather feel just like a type-safe function call. And that’s what “shareable” API definitions try to solve.
