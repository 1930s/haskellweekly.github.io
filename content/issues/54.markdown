-   [Loc, Span, and Area](https://chris-martin.org/2017/loc)

    > I started using haskell-src-exts recently to parse Haskell files to turn them into LaTeX for The Joy of Haskell. I wasn't used to this sort of parser that produces an AST that's mapped back to the source file by line and column numbers, so it took me a while to wrap my head around what to do with its output. After a while, I settled on some types, invented some terminology, and published a library: loc.

-   [Dialogues on do notation](https://joyofhaskell.com/posts/2017-05-07-do-notation.html)

    > These dialogue snippets are from a series of conversations occurring over months, but we've edited them to try to present a mostly coherent presentation of what we think about do notation and why. The first time we realized that we have a disagreement came in a conversation about Applicative. This was right before I was going to teach a class about Applicative and was trying to figure out what syntax people unfamiliar with Applicative find easiest to read.
