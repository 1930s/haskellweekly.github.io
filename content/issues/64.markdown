-   [Announcing: the new unliftio library](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/07/announcing-new-unliftio-library)

    > For the past few years, Francesco Mazzoli and I have discussed issues around monad transformers --- and the need to run their actions in IO --- on a fairly regular basis. I wrote the monad-unlift library a while ago to try and address these concerns.

-   [Type safe dimensional analysis in Haskell](https://www.stephanboyer.com/post/131/type-safe-dimensional-analysis-in-haskell)

    > Years ago my colleague Gustavo asked how I would represent physical units like `m/s` or `kg*m/s^2` as types so the compiler can check that they match up and cancel correctly. F# supports this natively, but it felt weird to have it baked into the type system.

-   [Morgan Stanley open source: hobbes](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/5452)

    > Over the last few years, I have been developing hobbes --- a programming language, JIT compiler, and database system --- as part of my work for Morgan Stanley. It has become a critical piece of infrastructure in our low-latency, high-volume trading applications.

    > [NStack](https://nstack.com) lets data scientists and analysts to do sophisticated data work in the cloud without a team of engineers. Come help us build the platform for composable, data-driven microservices, using a mixture of Haskell and Linux systems tech. Reply via the link or email <jobs@nstack.com>.

-   [Demystifying Haskell assignment](http://www.haskellforall.com/2017/07/demistifying-haskell-assignment.html)

    > This post clarifies the distinction between `<-` and `=` in Haskell, which sometimes mystifies newcomers to the language. Most languages use only one symbol to assign values (such as `=` or `:=`), so why does Haskell use two?

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [language-ninja](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-ninja-0.1.0),
