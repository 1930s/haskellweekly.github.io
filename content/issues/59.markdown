Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

-   [Haskell on Android and iOS](http://keera.co.uk/blog/2017/06/01/haskell-android-ios/)

    > With our framework, writing professional Haskell apps and games becomes a reality. In minutes one can have the complete toolchain and see the first app running on a phone or published on the online store. If you weren't considering using Haskell yet, we hope you soon change your mind.

-   [Front Row is hiring a senior backend Haskell engineer](https://frontrow.workable.com/j/463B843754) (ad)

    > Come change how 6.5+ million K-12 US students learn Math, Language Arts, Social Studies and more. Use data, advanced type systems, great product design and deep pedagogy to change lives.

This week's package of the week is [generic-lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens-0.2.0.0),
a library that exposes generic data structure operations as lenses.
