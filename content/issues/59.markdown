Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
Haskell is a purely functional programming language that focuses on robustness, concision, and correctness.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

-   [Haskell on Android and iOS](http://keera.co.uk/blog/2017/06/01/haskell-android-ios/)

    > With our framework, writing professional Haskell apps and games becomes a reality. In minutes one can have the complete toolchain and see the first app running on a phone or published on the online store. If you weren't considering using Haskell yet, we hope you soon change your mind.

-   [Translating a C++ parser to Haskell](http://www.haskellforall.com/2017/06/translating-c-parser-to-haskell.html)

    > Recently I translated Nix's derivation parser to Haskell and I thought this would make an instructive example for how C++ idioms map to Haskell idioms. This post targets people who understand Haskell's basic syntax but perhaps have difficulty translating imperative style to a functional style.

-   [The `ReaderT` design pattern](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern)

    > What many languages address via patterns, in Haskell we address via language features (like built-in immutability, lambdas, laziness, etc.). However, I believe there is still room for some high-level guidance on structuring programs, which I'll loosely refer to as a Haskell design pattern.

-   [Front Row is hiring a senior backend Haskell engineer](https://frontrow.workable.com/j/463B843754) (ad)

    > Come change how 6.5+ million K-12 US students learn Math, Language Arts, Social Studies and more. Use data, advanced type systems, great product design and deep pedagogy to change lives.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [generic-lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens-0.2.0.0),
a library that exposes generic data structure operations as lenses.
